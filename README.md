# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-ML-Algorithms
This Project is done in conjuction with Udacity. As part of the requirements to graduate the Udacity Data Science nanodegree program, I have chosen this Project area for my capstone project 




## Description

Investment firms, hedge funds and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. A wealth of information is available in the form of historical stock prices and company performance data, suitable for machine learning algorithms to process.


For this project, I will build a stock price predictor that takes daily trading data over a certain date range as input, and outputs projected estimates for given query dates.
